## Aim:
Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App
Compare and analyze the UX of 2–3 competing apps/websites.
Develop and incorporate required changes in the analysed apps/websites.

## Algorithm:
**1. Objective**

To conduct a heuristic evaluation of existing grocery apps/websites, compare their UX design, identify usability issues, and suggest improvements based on Nielsen's 10 Heuristics.
This evaluation also includes a new conceptual app — GowSmart, developed based on the identified UX gaps in existing platforms.

**2. Selected Apps/Websites for Evaluation**

Category: Online Grocery Shopping

Selected Apps/Websites:

BigBasket (Website & App)

Blinkit (App)

JioMart (Website & App)

GowSmart (Proposed Concept App)

**3. Evaluation Methodology**

Evaluation Technique: Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics

Participants: 3 UX evaluators

Devices Used: Android mobile app and desktop browser

Evaluation Criteria: Rated on a 1–5 severity scale
(1 = Cosmetic problem, 2 = Minor, 3 = Major, 4 = Severe, 5 = Must fix)

**4. Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics – Summary Analysis**

Blinkit provides the best UX among existing apps, with clean layout and smooth real-time feedback.
BigBasket offers strong content structure but looks slightly outdated.
JioMart struggles with cluttered visuals and poor navigation.
GowSmart, designed after this evaluation, combines the strengths of all three by using a vibrant, modern interface and simplified layout for faster access.

**5. Comparative Summary**

Blinkit – 4.5 / 5

Strengths: Minimal design, real-time feedback, consistent visuals.

Weakness: Limited desktop features.

BigBasket – 3.8 / 5

Strengths: Comprehensive information, detailed help section.

Weakness: Slightly outdated UI.

JioMart – 2.9 / 5

Strengths: Wide product range.

Weakness: Poor navigation, inconsistent color scheme, cluttered homepage.

GowSmart – 4.7 / 5

Strengths: Bright and vibrant design, rounded icons, quick navigation, AI-based smart suggestions.

Weakness: Prototype stage; limited product data in current version.

**6. Proposed Improvements for Existing Apps**

Simplify JioMart’s homepage layout using card-based product views.

Add a bottom navigation bar in BigBasket for faster section switching.

Introduce confirmation dialogs and “undo” options for critical actions.

Use consistent Material Design icons across all pages.

Personalize shopping experience using AI-based product suggestions.

**7. Design Features of GowSmart (Proposed App)**

Theme: Bright and Vibrant with rounded icon-style buttons.

Tagline: “Smart Grocery, Smart You.”

Key UX Enhancements:

Personalized home screen with quick access to top categories.

Real-time cart updates and delivery status visibility.

Voice-assisted search and AI-based recommendations.

Gesture-friendly mobile navigation and consistent spacing for visual comfort.

**8. Conclusion**

Among the evaluated grocery apps, Blinkit currently offers the best real-world user experience. However, gaps remain in personalization, layout balance, and visual engagement.
The conceptual app GowSmart was developed as a solution that combines the best practices from competitors while addressing usability issues such as clutter, inconsistent visuals, and lack of personalization.
GowSmart’s clean layout, bright color palette, and intuitive navigation reflect the application of Gestalt principles and heuristic design rules, offering a more user-friendly and engaging grocery shopping experience.
